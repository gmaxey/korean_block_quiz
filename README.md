# Learn Korean by starting with single-block words

My prompt to Grok 3:

I'm trying to learn Korean and have been using Duolingo for the last 222 days. I find it very difficult to learn new words. I have a hypothesis that if I were to learn enough single-block words, it would make learning multi-block words easier, especially when the block have some relation to the work like with 신발, but even when they don't like with 양말, I have an extra set of mnemonic handles to grasp, as strange as sheep-horse might seem for "socks". I would to create a python-based web app to run on Ubuntu for Windows 11 to quiz me on single-block words. The words should be selected based on their frequency of use, both as word and as constituents of multi-block words.
